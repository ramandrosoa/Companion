## 🗺️ Overview

Companion is a quiz game that grows with you. The interface starts as a monochrome retro terminal and evolves into a sleek, modern UI as you progress through 5 stages. Each stage unlocks new features, harder questions, and a more expressive version of Pep — your AI companion.

- 🌱 **5 evolving stages** — Seed → Sprout → Sapling → Tree → Ancient, each with a distinct visual identity
- 🏛️ **Two quiz modes** — Capitals and Flags, 10 questions per session

- 💡 **Hint system** — available from Stage 3, with XP penalties per hint used
- 🐱 **Pep** — an AI companion powered by Groq that knows your stage, your country list, and your quiz results; personality evolves across stages
- 🔐 **Authentication** — login via username + email, stored in Upstash Redis

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### 🌱 Stages

| Stage | Name | Features unlocked |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🌱 Seed | 2-option questions, monochrome UI |
| 2 | 🌿 Sprout | 3-option questions, color tint choice |
| 3 | 🌳 Sapling | 4-option questions, full color palette, hints |
| 4 | 🌲 Tree | 4-option questions, modern UI, hints |
| 5 | ✨ Ancient | Free-type answers, cosmic UI, hints |

### ⚡ XP and Mastery

- Each question has a **10 XP lifetime cap**
- Correct answer = full XP (or reduced if hints were used)
- Once a question reaches 10 XP it is **mastered** — it still appears in sessions but earns 0 XP
- Stage up requires: **all 20 questions mastered** (10 capitals + 10 flags) AND **200 XP total**

### 💡 Hints (Stage 3+)

| Stage | Hint effect | XP |
|---|---|---|
| 🌳 3 | Removes one wrong option | 10 → 5 |
| 🌲 4 | First hint removes one option, second removes another | 10 → 6 → 2 |
| ✨ 5 | Type-answer mode — each hint reveals a wrong option | 10 → 7 → 4 → 1 |

### 📊 Accuracy

Accuracy is calculated as `theoretical XP earned / max possible XP × 100`. It reflects session performance regardless of mastery — a mastered question that earns 0 XP still counts toward theoretical XP.

### 🐱 Pep

Pep is an AI companion that lives in the bottom-right corner of every screen as an animated cat. Personality and knowledge scope evolve per stage:

| Stage | Personality | Knowledge scope |
|---|---|---|
| 🌱 1 | Excited 7-year-old | Stage 1 countries only |
| 🌿 2 | Casual teenager | Up to Stage 2 countries |
| 🌳 3 | Friendly young adult | Broader cultural knowledge |
| 🌲 4 | Knowledgeable adult | All countries |
| ✨ 5 | Measured professor | All countries + follow-up questions |

Pep auto-opens after sessions with performance feedback, on stage-up with congratulations, and on the menu with a personalised welcome-back message using the player's username.
